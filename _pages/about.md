I am currently a 2nd year Computer Science Master's student at the <a href='https://www.cs.usc.edu/'>University of Southern California (USC)</a>, set to graduate in 2024. My academic journey at USC has been enriched by my role as a Graduate Research Assistant at the <a href='https://ict.usc.edu/'>USC Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT)</a>, where I work with 3D Point Clouds. My current research focus lies in at the intersection of 3D GAN's and Diffusion Models for style transfer in the 3D domain. This past summer, I had the privilege to intern at <a href='https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref'>Nokia Bell Labs</a>, contributing to efficient geo-distributed LLM training across heterogeneous clusters.

Over the past 4 years, my passion for Machine Learning has led me to a variety of impactful projects and research endeavors. At <a href='https://www.episource.com/'>Episource LLC</a>, I developed a real-time Clinical Text Abbreviation Disambiguation solution and enhanced the companyâ€™s Named Entity Recognition (NER) model by mapping over 200 clinical drugs. My research at <a href='https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/'>RBCDSAI (IIT Madras)</a> saw me building an End-to-End framework for detecting Electricity Theft in Industrial Smart Grids, and at <a href='https://www.drdo.gov.in/'> DRDO HQ</a>, I devised a robust framework for malware analysis of images.

# Research Interests

My research revolves around the intricate interplay of AI, real-world applications, and ethical considerations. Key areas include:

- **Geo-distributed Training**: Tackling the complexities of large-scale ML model training in distributed systems.
- **3D Point Clouds**: Optimizing 3D representations using Diffusion and GANs.
- **Adversarial ML in NLP**: Navigating the challenges of adversarial attacks on LLMs.
- **Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)**: I'm particularly interested in aligning modalities within these models, with a focus on applications in robotics and video understanding.

I am motivated to bridge the theoretical and practical, always bearing in mind the ethical dimensions and real-world impact of my work.
