I am currently a 2nd year Computer Science Master's student at the <a href='https://www.cs.usc.edu/'>University of Southern California (USC)</a>, set to graduate in 2024. My academic journey at USC has been enriched by my role as a Graduate Research Assistant at the <a href='https://ict.usc.edu/'>USC Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT)</a>, where I delve into the world of 3D Point Clouds. My current research focus lies in harnessing the power of 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models for style transfer in the 3D domain. This past summer, I had the privilege to intern at <a href='https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref'>Nokia Bell Labs</a>, contributing to efficient geo-distributed LLM training across heterogeneous clusters.

Over the past 4 years, my passion for Machine Learning has led me to a variety of impactful projects and research endeavors. At <a href='https://www.episource.com/'>Episource LLC</a>, I developed a real-time Clinical Text Abbreviation Disambiguation solution and enhanced the companyâ€™s Named Entity Recognition (NER) model by mapping over 200 clinical drugs. My tenure at <a href='https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/'>RBCDSAI (IIT Madras)</a> saw me pioneering an End-to-End framework for detecting Electricity Theft in Industrial Smart Grids, and at <a href='https://www.drdo.gov.in/'> DRDO HQ</a>, I crafted a robust framework for malware analysis of images.

# Research Interests

My research delves into the intricate interplay of AI, real-world applications, and ethical considerations. Key areas include:

- **Interpretable ML in Healthcare**: Leveraging transparency in algorithms for patient-centered outcomes.
- **Smart Grids**: Crafting intelligent and sustainable energy solutions.
- **Adversarial ML in NLP**: Navigating the linguistic challenges of AI adversarial attacks.
- **Large Language Model Ethics**: Understanding the implications of LLM-driven language.
- **3D Point Clouds**: Optimizing 3D representations using Diffusion and GANs.
- **Geo-distributed Training**: Tackling the complexities of large-scale ML model training in distributed systems.
- **AI Deployment Ethics**: Making AI in NLP and Vision robust, ethical, and practical.

My overarching goal is to bridge the theoretical and practical, always bearing in mind the ethical dimensions and real-world ramifications of AI advancements.
