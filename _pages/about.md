I am a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the **[School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI)](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/)**, **[Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/)**, advised by **[Dr. Pooyan Fazli](https://search.asu.edu/profile/4408705)** and part of the **[People and Robots Laboratory (PeRL)](https://www.pooyanfazli.com/index.html)**. My research revolves around extending Large Vision Language Models (LVLMS) for Video Understanding and aligning with human preferences using Reinforcement Learning.

Previously, I graduated from the **[University of Southern California (USC)](https://www.cs.usc.edu/)** with a Master's in Computer Science. At USC, I was a Graduate Research Assistant at the 
**[USC Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT)](https://ict.usc.edu/)**, where I worked with 3D Point Clouds, particularly at the intersection of GANs, Diffusion Models, and Gaussian Splatting for style transfer in the 3D domain. In Summer 2023, I had the privilege to intern at **[Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref)**, contributing to efficient geo-distributed LLM training across heterogeneous clusters.

Before coming to the US, I graduated from the **[Pune Institute of Computer Technology](https://pict.edu/)** with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. During those four years, my passion for Machine Learning led me to a variety of impactful projects and research endeavors. At **[Episource LLC](https://www.episource.com/)**, I developed a real-time Clinical Text Abbreviation Disambiguation solution and enhanced the company’s Named Entity Recognition (NER) model by mapping over 200 clinical drugs. My research at **[RBCDSAI (IIT Madras)](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/)** involved building an End-to-End framework for detecting Electricity Theft in Industrial Smart Grids, and at **[DRDO HQ](https://www.drdo.gov.in/)**, I devised a robust framework for malware analysis of images.

I was born and raised in New Delhi, where I spent 14 years at **[Mount Carmel School](https://mountcarmelschool.com/our-schools/)**. My journey took me from Pune for my undergraduate studies, to Los Angeles for my Master’s, a summer in New York City, and now to Tempe, Arizona. Life has a way of taking us on unexpected journeys, and I’ve learned to follow where it leads.
