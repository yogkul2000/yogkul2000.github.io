I am currently a 2nd year Computer Science Master's student at the University of Southern California (USC), set to graduate in 2024. My academic journey at USC has been enriched by my role as a Graduate Research Assistant, where I delve into the world of 3D Point Clouds. My current research focus lies in harnessing the power of 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models for style transfer in the 3D domain. This past summer, I had the privilege to intern at Nokia Bell Labs, contributing to efficient geo-distributed LLM training across heterogeneous clusters.

Over the past 4 years, my passion for Machine Learning has led me to a variety of impactful projects and research endeavors. At Episource LLC, I developed a real-time Clinical Text Abbreviation Disambiguation solution and enhanced the companyâ€™s Named Entity Recognition (NER) model by mapping over 200 clinical drugs. My tenure at RBCDSAI (IIT Madras) saw me pioneering an End-to-End framework for detecting Electricity Theft in Industrial Smart Grids, and at DRDO HQ, I crafted a robust framework for malware analysis of images.

My research interests are multifaceted, converging on areas such as Interpretable Machine Learning for Healthcare, Efficient Algorithms for Smart Grids, and Secure IoT Systems for Smart Cities. I'm also deeply intrigued by Adversarial Machine Learning in NLP and the ethical dimensions of Large Language Models. When I step away from the academic realm, I find solace in streaming captivating series on Netflix, enjoying intense Tennis matches, or taking long, rejuvenating walks.
